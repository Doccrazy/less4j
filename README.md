Less4j is a port of [less.js](http://lesscss.org/) into Java. 

Roadmap:
1.  add comments handling into grammar as exists now,

2.  clean up unit tests,

3.  make it compatible with css2.1 and css3,

4.  make API,

5.  add less.js features and document the grammar while doing it,

6.  finalize API.

Architecture:
I'm still experimenting with the architecture. TODO

API:
Not finished yet.
