Less4j is a port of [less.js](http://lesscss.org/) into Java. 

## Roadmap:
*  add comments handling into grammar as exists now,
*  clean up unit tests,
*  write better README.mf,
*  add basic CSS hacks into it to see whether it is possible,
*  make it compatible with css2.1 and css3,
*  make API,
*  add less.js features and document the grammar while doing it,
*  finalize API.

## Architecture:
I'm still experimenting with the architecture. 

## API:
Not finished yet.
